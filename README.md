# Simple Pub/Sub for Java7

## Purpose
This basic example doesn't use Spring libs such as `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-gcp-starter-pubsub`.
Hopefully this integrates with our old Java7 Spring Projects without causing build conflicts or forcing us 
to invest in heavy upgrades.

## Build
`mvn clean compile`
